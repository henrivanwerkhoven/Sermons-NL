msgid "How do I start using the plugin?"

#: sermons-nl.php:534
msgid ""
"After installing and activating the plugin, a page \"Sermons-NL\" is added "
"to the main menu of your WP Admin. In the submenu \"Configuration\" you can "
"enter the details of the services that you want to include. Specific "
"instructions per service are provided there."
msgstr ""

msgid "How do I add a list of (planned) broadcasts to my website?"
msgstr ""

#: sermons-nl.php:537
msgid ""
"The plugin Sermons-NL uses shortcodes to add (planned) broadcasts to your "
"website. For a list of (planned) broadcasts, you will find a shortcode "
"builder on the landing page of the plugin, via the main menu of the WP "
"Admin. You can also add individual events or even a single broadcast to your "
"website. To this end, navigate to the Administration submenu, find the "
"relevant church service or item, and click the copy icon for the given "
"shortcode. You can paste the shortcode on a page or in a message."

"We have broadcasted an event that I don't want to include in the list of "
"(planned) broadcasts. How do I do that?"
msgstr ""

#: sermons-nl.php:540
msgid ""
"You can do so by finding the event in the Administration submenu, and "
"unticking the \"Include in (planned) broadcasts list\" option. Don't forget "
"to press the Save button.\n"
"If you want to prevent a future broadcasted event to be included in the "
"(planned) broadcasts list, you can create a new event manually (\"Create new "
"event\" option in the Administration submenu) and enter the appropriate date "
"and time of the planned event. Untick the \"Include in (planned) broadcasts "
"list\" option. Note that the \"Protect from automated deletion\" option "
"should be ticked if you create the manual event entry before the day of the "
"broadcasted event, otherwise it will be deleted overnight. As soon as the "
"new broadcast is detected, the plugin will link it to this manual event, "
"which will avoid inclusion in the (planned) broadcasts list.\n"
"Note that you can include this broadcasted event on your website, for "
"example in a news message, by using the shortcode for events that you find "
"in the Administration page."

"The automatic linkage of items from different services has gone wrong. What "
"should I do?"
msgstr ""

#: sermons-nl.php:545
msgid ""
"This sometimes happens, e.g. if the broadcasting is started much earlier so "
"that linking it to the planned event is not unambiguous, or if multiple "
"broadcasts of the same type are detected, for example if the broadcast "
"service has been interrupted. It is easy to fix afterwards. Go to the "
"Administration submenu and find the event  that has this error. You can "
"unlink the item that was not correctly linked (it will end up under the "
"\"Unlinked items\") or directly link it to another event. If the event has "
"no other linked items, you can now delete it. Go to the unlinked items if "
"you want to link them to another event. Only items with the same date can be "
"linked."

msgid "Why does Sermons-NL not support Kerkdienst Gemist?"
msgstr ""

#: sermons-nl.php:548
msgid ""
"Kerkdienst Gemist is a service similar to Kerkomroep. Currently, only "
"Kerkomroep is included, because the church for which the plugin was first "
"developed uses that service. However, adding support for Kerkdienst Gemist "
"is possible if a church using Kerkdienst Gemist is willing to assist in "
"testing and debugging. In that case, please visit the issue page and add "
"your reaction or send an e-mail to the developer."

msgid ""
"Shortcodes for standalone items may produce the error [invalid shortcode] "

"The plugin doesn't allow you to include the same item or event twice on the "

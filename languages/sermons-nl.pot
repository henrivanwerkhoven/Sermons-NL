"The plugin Sermons-NL uses shortcodes to add sermons to your website. For a "

"you can create a new event manually (\"Create new event\" option in the "

"\"Protect from automated deletion\" option should be on, especially if you "
"create the manual event entry before the day of the broadcast, or else you "
"will loose it overnight. As soon as the new broadcast is detected, the "
"plugin will link it to this manual event and will avoid the creation of a "

msgstr ""

#: sermons-nl.php:542
msgid ""
"Kerkdienst Gemist is a service similar to Kerkomroep. Currently, only "

"Shortcodes for standalone items may produce the error [invalid shortcode] "
